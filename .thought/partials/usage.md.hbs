# Usage

Let's assume, we have a service that does not detach, but it is not ready immediately after start.
We want to start this service call some endpoints and stop it again (for example in tests).
Assume that our service is implemented in `service.js` (for portability, we use a Node.js program in this
example, but I actually wrote this tool for use with [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel).

We can now do the following.

{{{example 'examples/example.js'}}}

This will start the service, wait until the stdout matches pattern, then call an endpoint and stop it again.
The output of this program is:

{{{exec 'node example.js' cwd='examples/'}}}
